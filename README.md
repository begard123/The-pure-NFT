# A look at the history of NFTs in the world of cryptocurrencies
The birth of NFTs began in 2017 with the launch of projects such as CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties. CryptoPunks were actually a collection of pixelated characters that made up 10,000 unique items. These CryptoPunks were initially free, but later, due to their popularity, they priced these NFTs and today their value has reached a level where they are on the list of the most expensive NFTs. The projects on the NFT platform are still developing and have been able to find their way into various industries and applications.
# What are the important features of an NFT?
NFTs can be any digital artwork, such as paintings, music, or anything else that has been taken from your mind and creativity and transformed and transferred to artificial intelligence. For example, Dogecoin is not an NFT, but a GIF of Dogecoin is a non-fungible token that can be sold and traded on the best NFT trading platforms. The most important features and benefits of non-fungible tokens include:
Rarity
Indivisible
Transferable
Originality
Uniqueness
Protecting ownership rights
# How do NFTs work?
The information captured in an NFT essentially allows a designer to turn their art into a digital autograph. Even if an image or piece of music has been shared hundreds of times, if you buy it as an NFT, youâ€™re buying something unique. The rise in value of this class of digital assets has made learning how to make NFTs a hot topic, especially for artists.
